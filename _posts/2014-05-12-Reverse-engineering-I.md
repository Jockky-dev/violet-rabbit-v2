This is stage one of the reverse engineering challenge you will need to solve this stage to proceeded to stage II there are flags for team members at each stage. keep in mind that each flag can only be used be one so be quick~ 
The further you make it into the challenge the less competition you will have so stay motivated 

```c
int main (){
	int hello = 3;
	char world = 'w';
}
```



```java
import java.util.Scanner;  // Import the Scanner class

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner myObj = new Scanner(System.in);  // Create a Scanner object
    System.out.println("Enter username");

    String userName = myObj.nextLine();  // Read user input
    System.out.println("Username is: " + userName);  // Output user input
  }
}

```

```python3.7


```
