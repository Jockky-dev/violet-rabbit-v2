            Duck is the common name for numerous species in the waterfowl family 
            Anatidae which also includes swans and geese. 
            Ducks are divided among several subfamilies in the family Anatidae; 
            they do not represent a monophyletic group but a form taxon,
            since swans and geese are not considered ducks.
